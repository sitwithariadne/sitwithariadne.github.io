## Express
Feelings and opinions. Keep statements about how you feel.

~~"You ignore me all the time!"~~

> "I feel lonely when you spend so much time on your phone."

~~"You always make me beg you do to the dishes."~~

> "I'm frustrated the dishes haven't been done."

## Assert
Ask for what you want. Say no clearly. Others cannot read your mind.

> "Please spend some time with me."

> "We've agreed that each of us does the dishes, every other meal.

## Reinforce
Explain a positive outcome that happens if you get what you want.

> "We can play a game together.

> "When the dishes are done, we'll both feel better.

## Mindfully
Focus on your goal. Don't get distracted.


## Appear Confident 
Use a confident tone of voice, make eye contact, an assertive posture.

## Negotiate
Give to get, reduce the request, say no, but offer to do something else, focus on what would work.
